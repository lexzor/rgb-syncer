RGB Syncer actually refers to hardware that has RGB Components from Corsair and Gigabyte. In my case all RGB Components are mounted on a Gigabyte motherboard excepting RAM Memory which it's a Corsair comp.

In order for RAM to be seen on RGB Fusion from Gigabyte Control Center program, ICUE must be opened before GCC. This program simply take both executable path and open them at windows startup.

To add this program in startup items, press 'WinKey + R' and type 'shell:startup'. In this folder you can add your own applications that you want to be opened when windows start. Here you can add the compiled program or a shortcut to it.
