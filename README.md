RGB Syncer actually refers to RGB HW components from Gigabyte and Corsair. In my case, RGB Components (case, CPU AIO, GPU) are mounted on a Gigabyte motherboard excepting RAM Memory which it's a Corsair comp.

In order for RAM to be seen on RGB Fusion from Gigabyte Control Center program, ICUE must be opened before GCC and without any Lighting Effects for the in cause component. This program simply use both executable path to open them with a delay of 2.5 seconds.

To add this program in startup items, press 'WinKey + R' and type 'shell:startup'. In this folder you can add the compiled program or a shortcut to it's executable.
